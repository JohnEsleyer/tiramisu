# Library Usage

To use **Tiramisu** in a separate Bun project, follow this guide. Tiramisu uses "Source-First" exports, meaning Bun will run the library's TypeScript code directly without a manual build step.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Bun**
- **FFmpeg**

## 2. Installation
```bash
# Add Tiramisu as a dependency
bun add https://github.com/JohnEsleyer/tiramisu
```
